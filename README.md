* An artificial intelligence programming challenge targeted at students.
* AIs compete by controlling bouncy little circles ("seekers") trying to collect the most goals.
* Based on Python 3.9 and pygame.

## This repository contains

- üéÆ A classic python implementation of the seekers game (classic, unsave)
- üåê A gRPC api server and client implementation (new, protected)

Players can join the Seekers Game in two ways:
1. as gRPC clients (new and safe way)
2. as a local file whose `decide`-function is called directly from within the game (old and unsafe way)
   * This is discouraged as it allows players to access the game's internals and cheat. See [this issue](https://github.com/seekers-dev/seekers/issues/1).
   * useful for debugging/AI-developement

## Getting started

### Installation

* Download the latest release
* Python 3.9 or higher is required
* Install the packages in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

alternatively:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Depending on how you installed python, you might have to use `py` or `python3` instead of `python`.

* Download the necessary grpc stubs from [seekers-dev/seekers-grpc](https://github.com/seekers-dev/seekers-grpc/releases) and put the folder `./stubs/` in `./seekers/grpc/`.

### Create server and run clients

This will:
* start a Seekers Game
* run a gRPC server by default

```shell
python run_seekers.py <AI files>
```


### Run one single client

‚ö† You will need a separate server running. This can be the server above, or, for example, [the Java implementation](https://github.com/seekers-dev/seekers-api).

```shell
python run_client.py <AI file>
```

## Build on your own

You can compile the gRPC stubs manually

* Install packages in [`seekers/grpc/requirements-dev.txt`](seekers/grpc/requirements-dev.txt). 
* Execute [`seekers/grpc/compile_protos.sh`](seekers/grpc/compile_protos.sh).
